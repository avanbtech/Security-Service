The directory structure of our project can be briefly explained as follows:

Important directory locations:

Web server:
nginx-config/default: Nginx configuration for our deployed web server. This needs to be modified and copied to our VM whenever we change the web server.
nginx-config/certs: Stores our generated HTTPS certificates for use in nginx-config/default.

Database:
src/data/db.js: Stores configuration information for the database. You must change the password in this file to align with your mySQL password installed on your machine.

Python:
src/PyScripts/pyoptions.js: Stores python configuration options. You must edit the python path and directory in this folder for python scripts to work properly.


Rest of directories:
.git: Git folder to store git information.
~Project-Information-Documents: Stores documents to explain basic instructions on how our code works.
build: Built materials - Not a folder we need to worry about.
DB Docs: Basic documentation on how to initialize our database.
mailservice: Stores code that deals with our mailing service.
materials: Stores some referenced files in our front end code.
mysql: Stores some mysql scripts, notably the one that we use to create the table for our security request system.
nginx-config: Stores web server configuration which reverse proxies into our node.js code.

src: Stores our source code.
src/components: Stores the react code for our front-end.
src/controllers: Holds back end code for our web app.
src/data: More database code and configuration, some generated with GraphQL.
src/PyScripts: Python scripts.
src/routes: React routes.
src/server.js: Where our server code is initialized.

Testing Tools: Contains a python script to autofill our security system form.
tools: More useful npm command files that can be called (npm start)
