# Security Service Request System 
## About
This is group Gammas CMPT 373 Term Project.  We are developing a web application form to replace the current SFU security services request system with an online solution, that the "customer" can fill out the necessary information, which then will be automatically accessible to security for further processing.
We are using the MERN stack to complete this project, consisting of MongoDB (NoSQL Database), Express (Framework for web applications) , React (Front end framework - HTML/CSS etc.), and Node.js (Server side, back end framework) as the underlying frameworks.

## Initial setup instructions 

**(Requires more detailed initial setup information here to be filled too)**

Please install dependencies using 'npm install' before build from source 

Here are several npm commands to build and deploy the application on your own working environment:

```
npm start
npm build
npm deploy
npm test
npm copy
npm clean
```
