Instructions to setup the python shell and scripts:
  1. Make sure you have installed python3.xx on the machine

  2. Using python package manager (pip3) use the following commands in terminal
     to install necessary python frameworks (more frameworks maybe added later):
      - pip3 install PyPDF2
      - pip3 install reportlab
      - pip3 install requests
      - pip3 install pandas
      - pip3 install selenium
      - pip3 install Faker

  3. Go to src/PyScripts/pyoptions.js and replace the python3 executable path
     (use command which python3 on your machine to find out this path)

  4. Replace scriptPath in the same file to PyScripts folder on your machine.

  5. Run npm install if you haven't done it in a while to install all the new
     node packages.
