# Nginx configuration file to reverse proxy connections to our domain to certain ports.
# Without this, to access our website you would go to cmpt373-1177g.cmpt.sfu.ca:3001 for http access and formerly 3005 for TLS
# With this, you can access it via cmpt373-1177g.cmpt.sfu.ca
# Nginx will automatically proxy http connnections to cmpt373-1177g.cmpt.sfu.ca to port 3001, while hiding the port
# It will also automatically force all http connections to https, while hiding which ports we host them on
# Therefore, when a user connects to our site, it will simply show: https://cmpt373-1177g.cmpt.sfu.ca

# This file is used in /etc/nginx/sites-available
# cd to this directory and do these commands:
# sudo cp default /etc/nginx/sites-available
# sudo service nginx restart
# sudo nginx -t (This checks if the script loaded properly)
